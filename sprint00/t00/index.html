  <h2 id="first">What makes a superhero?</h2>
  <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do
    them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero,
    <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human
    being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
    Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
    <br><br>
    For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or
    detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower
    who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing
    something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume
    he becomes a superhero.</p>
